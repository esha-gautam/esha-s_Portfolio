Overview:

In this module we will implement the knowledge acquired from previous module and create a mini project on Airline dataset. 

Situations: 

You have been given a dataset which contains data from different Airlines. You have gathered the requirement from the client on the analysis that has to be performed using the dataset. The analysis is for different airports from which the airlines depart and arrive. The average delay time of an airline over a period of time and more. 

Output: 

The output should look like following: 

1. Flight Status Analysis:

2. Air Traffic Analysis:

Tasks: 

1. Analyse the flight status (on time, delayed, cancelled) month wise and airline wise. Also have a look at average delay time for that duration. 
1. Air traffic analysis is to be performed which gives insights as when is the best time to book a flight and what is the peak hour when the maximum flights are available. 
1. Publish the report to web and pin the tiles to a dashboard. 
1. Share the dashboard with colleagues.

Solutions: 

1. Analyse the flight status (on time, delayed, cancelled) month wise and airline wise. Also have a look at average delay time for that duration. 

` `**Solution steps:** 

**Note:** Detailed steps are already explained in previous modules. For all the below mentioned steps, keep the interactivity as shown in attached images. 

1. Create a Month selector to switch between different months as shown below:

2. Select and create horizontal bar graph to interact with other visualizations. Pie chart and vertical bar graph are filtered by horizontal bar graph as shown below:

3. The selector chosen depicts the interactivity of selector with other visualizations.

4. Create Pie chart consisting of flights cancelled, flights delayed, and on-time values with the interactivity as shown:

5. Create the vertical bar graph and as shown it has no interactivity with other visualizations except with the KPI.

2. Air traffic analysis is to be performed which gives insights as when is the best time to book a flight and what is the peak hour when the maximum flights are available. 

**Solution steps:** 

a.  Create the Air traffic analysis in a new page similar to step 1. Keep the interactivity of filters and selectors as shown in the below image:

3. Publish the report to web and pin the tiles to a dashboard. 

**Solution steps:** 

a.  After publishing Airline Analysis from desktop the file is available to be used in web:
